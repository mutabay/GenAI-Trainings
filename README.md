# GenAI-Trainings
Projects and materials from my Generative AI learning journey.

Welcome to my **Generative AI Trainings** repository! This repository contains all the projects, notebooks, and resources from the courses and materials I am using to enhance my skills in Generative AI.

## Courses and Projects

### 1. **Multi-AI Agent Systems with crewAI**
This section contains projects exploring multi-agent systems built with **crewAI**. These systems demonstrate how specialized agents collaborate to complete complex tasks across various domains. Each project is organized into its own folder:

#### Labs:
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration for Financial Analysis**  

- **Multi-Agent Customer Support**  

- **Multi-Agent Job Application Crew**  

- **Multi-Agent Research and Article Writing**  

- **Multi-Agent Tasks for Event Planning**  

- **Multi-Agent Tools for Customer Outreach**
