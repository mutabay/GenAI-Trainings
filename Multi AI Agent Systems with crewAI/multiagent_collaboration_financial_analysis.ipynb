      "Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California , in Silicon Valley . It is best known for its consumer electronics , software , and services . Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs , Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne , the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue , with US$391.04   billion in the 2024 fiscal year .\n",
      " The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II , became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers . Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse . By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, Inc. , and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share in the personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel -powered PC clones . In 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy . To resolve its failed operating system strategy, it bought NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability over the next decade with the introductions of the iMac , iPod , iPhone , and iPad devices to critical acclaim as well as the iTunes Store , launching the \" Think different \" advertising campaign, and opening the Apple Store retail chain. These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the world's most valuable brands since about 2010. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook .\n",
      " Apple's current product lineup includes portable and home hardware such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch , Mac , and Apple TV ; operating systems such as iOS , iPadOS , and macOS ; and various software and services including Apple Pay , iCloud , and multimedia streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV+ . Apple is one of the Big Five American information technology companies; [ a ] for the most part since 2011, [ b ] Apple has been the world's largest company by market capitalization , and, as of 2023 [update] , is the largest manufacturing company by revenue , the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales , the largest vendor of tablet computers , and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in 2018, and, as of December 2024 [update] , is valued at just over $3.74 trillion.\n",
      " Apple has received criticism regarding its contractors ' labor practices, its relationship with trade unions , its environmental practices , and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty .\n",

      "See also: History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\n",
      "In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple in Jobs's parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California . [ 8 ] Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\", [ 9 ] although they moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded. [ 10 ]\n",
      "The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without the required keyboard, monitor, power supply, and the optional case.\n",
      "Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs , Steve Wozniak , and Ronald Wayne as a partnership . [ 8 ] [ 11 ] The company's first product is the Apple I , a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak. [ 12 ] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus , and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator. [ 13 ] : 57  Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976. [ 14 ] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU , RAM , and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer. [ 15 ] It was priced soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023). [ 16 ] [ 17 ] : 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\". [ 18 ]\n",
      "Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated in Cupertino, California , [ 1 ] on January 3, 1977, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it. [ 21 ] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple. [ 22 ] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to US$118   million, an average annual growth rate of 533%. [ 23 ]\n",
      "The Apple II , also designed by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire . [ 24 ] It differs from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET , because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture . The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, which were superseded by the 5 + 1 ⁄ 4 -inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]\n",
      "The Apple II , introduced in 1977 and designed primarily by Wozniak, was the company's first major success.\n",
      "The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer application of the business world: VisiCalc , a spreadsheet program released in 1979. [ 25 ] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office, [ 25 ] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari , Commodore , and Tandy . [ 27 ] [ 28 ]\n",
      "On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022 [update] ), [ 20 ] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956. [ 29 ] By the end of the day, around 300 millionaires were created, including Jobs and Wozniak, from a stock price of $29 per share [ 30 ] and a market cap of $1.778 billion. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]\n",

      "Steve Jobs in 1984 with the Macintosh , the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse\n",
      "In December 1979, Steve Jobs and Apple employees, including Jef Raskin , visited Xerox PARC , where they observed the Xerox Alto , featuring a graphical user interface (GUI). Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC's technology, leading to Apple's option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple's products, starting with the Apple Lisa . Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.\n",
      " Jobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division. [ 31 ] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue. [ 32 ]\n",
      "In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language . [ 33 ] Its debut was signified by \" 1984 \", a US$1.5   million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984. [ 34 ] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success [ 35 ] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN [ 36 ] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide . [ 37 ]\n",
      "The advertisement created great interest in Macintosh , and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance. [ 38 ] : 195  In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley , who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs [ 39 ] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\" [ 40 ] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors. [ 41 ]\n",
      "The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership. [ 42 ] Jean-Louis Gassée informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties. [ 42 ] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT . [ 43 ] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\". [ 32 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative, [ 44 ] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year. [ 17 ] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders following their departures. [ 46 ]\n",
      "After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter , the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer . PageMaker , an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985. [ 47 ] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market. [ 48 ]\n",
      "This dominant position in the desktop publishing market [ 49 ] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin , and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II . [ 50 ] : 79–80\n",
      "This policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price. [ 50 ] : 117–129  During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer . [ 51 ] Gassée left the company later that year to set up a rival, Be Inc. [ 52 ]\n",
      "1990–1997: Decline and restructuring\n",
      "Macintosh LC II\n",
      "The company pivoted strategy and, in October 1990, introduced three lower-cost models: the Macintosh Classic , the Macintosh LC , and the Macintosh IIsi , all of which generated significant sales due to pent-up demand. [ 53 ] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7 , a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n",
      " \n",
      "The success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue. [ 54 ] For some time, Apple was doing very well, introducing fresh new products at increasing profits. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh. [ 55 ] The PenLite is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton . [ 56 ]\n",
      "The success of lower-cost consumer Macs, especially the LC, cannibalized higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, for different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models. [ 57 ]\n",
      "In 1993, the Apple II series was discontinued. It was expensive to produce, and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh. [ 58 ] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993. [ 59 ]\n",
      "Apple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including QuickTake digital cameras , PowerCD portable CD audio players, speakers , the Pippin video game console, the eWorld online service, and Apple Interactive Television Box . Enormous resources were invested in the problematic Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts. [ 60 ]\n",
      "Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience. [ 61 ] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. [ 62 ] The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed. The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler . [ 63 ]\n",
      "The Power Macintosh 6100 , introduced in 1994, was Apple's first new home computer model after the switch to PowerPC processors.\n",
      "Under Spindler, Apple, IBM , and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 to create a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform or PReP), with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh , the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor. [ 64 ]\n",
      "In the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones . Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest. [ 65 ]\n",
      "In 1996, Spindler was replaced as CEO by Gil Amelio , who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator. Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting. [ 66 ]\n",
      "This period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system ( System 1 ) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but still decided it needed a more modern approach. [ 67 ] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that same year, Copland in 1994, and evaluated the purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée , demanded $300 million in contrast to Apple's $125 million offer. [ 68 ] Only weeks away from bankruptcy , [ 69 ] Apple's board preferred NeXTSTEP and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, retaining Steve Jobs . [ 70 ]\n",
      "1997–2007: Return to profitability\n",
      "The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997, [ 71 ] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup. Jobs canceled 70% of models, ending 3,000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings. [ 72 ]\n",
      "The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software. [ 73 ] This was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices in the United States v. Microsoft Corp. case. [ 74 ] Around then, Jobs donated Apple's internal library and archives to Stanford University , to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] He ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing . [ 77 ] On November 10, 1997, the Apple Store website launched, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer Dell 's success. [ 78 ] The moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company had a $309 million profit. [ 72 ]\n",
      "iMac iBook Power Macintosh G3 PowerBook G3\n",
      "On May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac . The iMac was a huge success, with 800,000 units sold in its first five months, [ 79 ] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3 + 1 ⁄ 2 -inch diskette , being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with Internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac) [ 80 ] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by Jonathan Ive , who had been hired by Amelio, and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apple's product design. [ 81 ] [ 82 ]\n",
      "A little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook consumer laptop. It culminated Jobs's strategy to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation. [ 83 ]\n",
      "Around then, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired Macromedia 's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was launched as Final Cut Pro in April 1999. [ 84 ] Key Grip's development also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999. [ 85 ] Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple repackaged as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro , and reused its technology to create iDVD for the consumer market. [ 85 ] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene . Apple renamed the program iTunes , and simplified the user interface and added CD burning. [ 86 ]\n",
      "In 2001, Apple changed course with three announcements. First, on March 24, 2001, Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system, Mac OS X . This was after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X is based on NeXTSTEP , OpenStep , and BSD Unix , to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface. Second, in May 2001, the first two Apple Store retail locations opened in Virginia and California, offering an improved presentation of the company's products. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail, but they became highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.

[ 216 ] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores. [ 217 ] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers. [ 214 ] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts, [ 214 ] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.

      "On March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012. [ 218 ]\n",
      "On August 13, 2020, Epic Games , the maker of the popular game Fortnite , sued both Apple and Google after Fortnite was removed from Apple's and Google's app stores. The lawsuits came after Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system that bypassed the fees that Apple and Google had imposed. [ 219 ] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores. [ 220 ] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps and privacy rule changes. [ 221 ] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that \"this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners,\" commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.

      "PRISM is a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple. [ 223 ]\n",
      "Apple has publicly taken a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image. [ 224 ] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information. [ 225 ] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system. [ 226 ] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that Wired described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\". [ 227 ] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out. [ 228 ]\n",
      "However, Apple has aided law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices, [ 229 ] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer [ when? ] iPhone models , which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States. [ 230 ]\n",
      "With Apple's release of an update to iOS 14 , Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, called \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from Facebook , whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising . After Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in early 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking. [ 231 ]\n",
      "Prior to the release of iOS 15 , Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates. However, privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation , condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments. [ 232 ]\n",
      "Ireland's Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform. [ 233 ]\n",
      "In December 2019, security researcher Brian Krebs discovered that the iPhone 11 Pro would still show the arrow indicator –signifying location services are being used– at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled, despite all individual location services being disabled. Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment, he was told by Apple that \"It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled. The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings.\" [ 234 ] \n",
      "Apple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with ultra-wideband regulations in specific countries, a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone 11 Pro, and emphasized that \"the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data.\" Will Strafach, an executive at security firm Guardian Firewall , confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server. Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the device's location. [ 235 ] [ 236 ]\n",
      "According to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\" [ 237 ]\n",

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \" 1984 \" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors. [ 256 ] According to a 2011 report in Fortune , this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation. [ 257 ] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple. [ 258 ]\n",

On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value, [ 306 ] [ 307 ] and as of June 2024 [update] , is valued at just over $3.2 trillion. [ 7 ] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by revenue . [ 308 ]\n",
      "In July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China. [ 309 ] That year, Apple was one of the largest corporate spenders on research and development worldwide, with R&D expenditure amounting to over $27 billion. [ 310 ]\n",
      "In May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia. [ 311 ]\n",
      "Taxes\n",
      "Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to The New York Times , in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \" Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich \", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean. [ 312 ] [ 313 ]\n",
      "British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012, [ 314 ] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company , to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax. [ 315 ]\n",
      "According to a US Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure. [ 316 ] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said. [ 317 ] On May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing. [ 318 ]\n",
      "Apple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY 2016. [ 319 ] In an interview with the German newspaper FAZ in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide. [ 320 ]\n",
      "In 2016, after a two-year investigation , the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the commission had provided insufficient evidence. [ 321 ] [ 322 ] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following eight years. [ 323 ]\n",

      "A financial ratio or accounting ratio states the relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise's financial statements . Often used in accounting , there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios may be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors . Financial analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies. [ 1 ] If shares in a company are publicly listed, the market price of the shares is used in certain financial ratios.\n",
      " Ratios can be expressed as a decimal value , such as 0.10, or given as an equivalent percentage value, such as 10%. Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield , while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio ; these latter are also called multiples . Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal ; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%.\n",
      "Sources of data [ edit ]\n",
      "Values used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the balance sheet , income statement , statement of cash flows or (sometimes) the statement of changes in equity . These comprise the firm's \"accounting statements\" or financial statements . The statements' data is based on the accounting method and accounting standards used by the organisation.\n",
      "Purpose and types [ edit ]\n",
      "Federal debt to Federal revenue ratio\n",
      "Financial ratios quantify many aspects of a business and are an integral part of the financial statement analysis . Financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business which the ratio measures.\n",
      "Profitability ratios measure the firm's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return. [ 2 ]\n",
      "Liquidity ratios measure the availability of cash to pay debt. [ 3 ]\n",
      "Efficiency (activity) ratios measure how quickly a firm converts non-cash assets to cash assets. [ 4 ]\n",
      "Debt ratios measure the firm's ability to repay long-term debt. [ 5 ]\n",
      "Market ratios measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock. [ 6 ]\n",
      "These are concerned with the return on investment for shareholders , and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares.\n",
      " Financial ratios allow for comparisons\n",
      "between companies\n",
      "between industries\n",
      "between different time periods for one company\n",
      "between a single company and its industry average\n",
      "Ratios generally are not useful unless they are benchmarked against something else, like past performance or another company. Thus, the ratios of firms in different industries, which face different risks, capital requirements, and competition are usually hard to compare.\n",
      "Accounting methods and principles [ edit ]\n",
      "Financial ratios may not be directly comparable between companies that use different accounting methods or follow various standard accounting practices . Most public companies are required by law to use generally accepted accounting principles for their home countries, but private companies , partnerships and sole proprietorships may elect to not use accrual basis accounting. Large multi-national corporations may use International Financial Reporting Standards to produce their financial statements, or they may use the generally accepted accounting principles of their home country.\n",
      " There is no international standard for calculating the summary data presented in all financial statements, and the terminology is not always consistent between companies, industries, countries and time periods.\n",
      "Types of Ratio Comparisons [ edit ]\n",
      "An important feature of ratio analysis is interpreting ratio values. A meaningful basis for comparison is needed to answer questions such as \"Is it too high or too low?\" or \"Is it good or bad?\". Two types of ratio comparisons can be made, cross-sectional and time-series. [ 7 ]\n",
      "Cross-Sectional Analysis [ edit ]\n",
      "Cross-sectional analysis compares the financial ratios of different companies at the same point in time. It allows companies to benchmark from other competitors by comparing their ratio values to similar companies in the industry.\n",
      "Time-Series Analysis [ edit ]\n",
      "Time-series analysis evaluates a company's performance over time. It compares its current performance against past or historical performance. This can help assess the company's progress by looking into developing trends or year-to-year changes.\n",
      "Abbreviations and terminology [ edit ]\n",
      "Various abbreviations may be used in financial statements, especially financial statements summarized on the Internet . Sales reported by a firm are usually net sales , which deduct returns, allowances, and early payment discounts from the charge on an invoice . Net income is always the amount after taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest, unless otherwise stated. Otherwise, the amount would be EBIT, or EBITDA (see below).\n",
      " Companies that are primarily involved in providing services with labour do not generally report \"Sales\" based on hours. These companies tend to report \"revenue\" based on the monetary value of income that the services provide.\n",
      " Note that Shareholders' Equity and Owner's Equity are not the same thing, Shareholder's Equity represents the total number of shares in the company multiplied by each share's book value; Owner's Equity represents the total number of shares that an individual shareholder owns (usually the owner with controlling interest ), multiplied by each share's book value. It is important to make this distinction when calculating ratios.\n",
      "Abbreviations [ edit ]\n",
      "( Note: These are not ratios, but values in currency.)\n",
      "COGS = Cost of goods sold, or cost of sales.\n",

      "A financial ratio or accounting ratio states the relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise's financial statements . Often used in accounting , there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios may be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors . Financial analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies. [ 1 ] If shares in a company are publicly listed, the market price of the shares is used in certain financial ratios.\n",
      " Ratios can be expressed as a decimal value , such as 0.10, or given as an equivalent percentage value, such as 10%. Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield , while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio ; these latter are also called multiples . Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal ; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%.\n",
      "Sources of data [ edit ]\n",
      "Values used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the balance sheet , income statement , statement of cash flows or (sometimes) the statement of changes in equity . These comprise the firm's \"accounting statements\" or financial statements . The statements' data is based on the accounting method and accounting standards used by the organisation.\n",
      "Purpose and types [ edit ]\n",
      "Federal debt to Federal revenue ratio\n",
      "Financial ratios quantify many aspects of a business and are an integral part of the financial statement analysis . Financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business which the ratio measures.\n",
      "Profitability ratios measure the firm's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return. [ 2 ]\n",
      "Liquidity ratios measure the availability of cash to pay debt. [ 3 ]\n",
      "Efficiency (activity) ratios measure how quickly a firm converts non-cash assets to cash assets. [ 4 ]\n",
      "Debt ratios measure the firm's ability to repay long-term debt. [ 5 ]\n",
      "Market ratios measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock. [ 6 ]\n",
      "These are concerned with the return on investment for shareholders , and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares.\n",
      " Financial ratios allow for comparisons\n",
      "between companies\n",
      "between industries\n",
      "between different time periods for one company\n",
      "between a single company and its industry average\n",
      "Ratios generally are not useful unless they are benchmarked against something else, like past performance or another company. Thus, the ratios of firms in different industries, which face different risks, capital requirements, and competition are usually hard to compare.\n",
      "Accounting methods and principles [ edit ]\n",
      "Financial ratios may not be directly comparable between companies that use different accounting methods or follow various standard accounting practices . Most public companies are required by law to use generally accepted accounting principles for their home countries, but private companies , partnerships and sole proprietorships may elect to not use accrual basis accounting. Large multi-national corporations may use International Financial Reporting Standards to produce their financial statements, or they may use the generally accepted accounting principles of their home country.\n",
      " There is no international standard for calculating the summary data presented in all financial statements, and the terminology is not always consistent between companies, industries, countries and time periods.\n",
      "Types of Ratio Comparisons [ edit ]\n",
      "An important feature of ratio analysis is interpreting ratio values. A meaningful basis for comparison is needed to answer questions such as \"Is it too high or too low?\" or \"Is it good or bad?\". Two types of ratio comparisons can be made, cross-sectional and time-series. [ 7 ]\n",
      "Cross-Sectional Analysis [ edit ]\n",
      "Cross-sectional analysis compares the financial ratios of different companies at the same point in time. It allows companies to benchmark from other competitors by comparing their ratio values to similar companies in the industry.\n",
      "Time-Series Analysis [ edit ]\n",
      "Time-series analysis evaluates a company's performance over time. It compares its current performance against past or historical performance. This can help assess the company's progress by looking into developing trends or year-to-year changes.\n",
      "Abbreviations and terminology [ edit ]\n",
      "Various abbreviations may be used in financial statements, especially financial statements summarized on the Internet . Sales reported by a firm are usually net sales , which deduct returns, allowances, and early payment discounts from the charge on an invoice . Net income is always the amount after taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest, unless otherwise stated. Otherwise, the amount would be EBIT, or EBITDA (see below).\n",
      " Companies that are primarily involved in providing services with labour do not generally report \"Sales\" based on hours. These companies tend to report \"revenue\" based on the monetary value of income that the services provide.\n",
      " Note that Shareholders' Equity and Owner's Equity are not the same thing, Shareholder's Equity represents the total number of shares in the company multiplied by each share's book value; Owner's Equity represents the total number of shares that an individual shareholder owns (usually the owner with controlling interest ), multiplied by each share's book value. It is important to make this distinction when calculating ratios.\n",
      "Abbreviations [ edit ]\n",
      "( Note: These are not ratios, but values in currency.)\n",
      "COGS = Cost of goods sold, or cost of sales.\n",

      "Financial analysis (also known as financial statement analysis , accounting analysis , or analysis of finance ) refers to an assessment of the viability, stability, and profitability of a business , sub-business, project or investment.\n",
      "It is performed by professionals who prepare reports using ratios and other techniques, that make use of information taken from financial statements and other reports. These reports are usually presented to top management as one of their bases in making business decisions. \n",
      "Financial analysis may determine if a business will:\n",
      "Continue or discontinue its main operation or part of its business;\n",
      "Make or purchase certain materials in the manufacture of its product;\n",
      "Acquire or rent/lease certain machineries and equipment in the production of its goods;\n",
      "Issue shares or negotiate for a bank loan to increase its working capital ;\n",
      "Make decisions regarding investing or lending capital;\n",
      "Make other decisions that allow management to make an informed selection on various alternatives in the conduct of its business.\n",
      "Firm-level analysis [ edit ]\n",
      "Financial analysts often assess the following elements of a firm:\n",
      "Profitability - its ability to earn income and sustain growth in both the short- and long-term. A company's degree of profitability is usually based on the income statement , which reports on the company's results of operations;\n",
      "Solvency - its ability to pay its obligation to creditors and other third parties in the long-term;\n",
      "Liquidity - its ability to maintain positive cash flow , while satisfying immediate obligations;\n",
      "Stability - the firm's ability to remain in business in the long run, without having to sustain significant losses in the conduct of its business. Assessing a company's stability requires the use of both the income statement and the balance sheet, as well as other financial and non-financial indicators.\n",
      "Both 2 and 3 are based on the company's balance sheet , which indicates the financial condition of a business as of a given point in time.\n",
      "Techniques [ edit ]\n",
      "Financial analysts often compare financial ratios (of solvency , profitability , growth, etc.):\n",
      "Past Performance - Across historical time periods for the same firm (the last 5 years for example),\n",
      "Future Performance - Using historical figures and certain mathematical and statistical techniques, including present and future values, This extrapolation method is the main source of errors in financial analysis as past statistics can be poor predictors of future prospects.\n",
      "Comparative Performance - Comparison between similar firms\n",
      "Comparing financial ratios is merely one way of conducting financial analysis. \n",
      "Financial analysts can also use percentage analysis which involves reducing a series of figures as a percentage of some base amount. [ 1 ] For example, a group of items can be expressed as a percentage of net income. When proportionate changes in the same figure over a given time period expressed as a percentage is known as horizontal analysis. [ 2 ]\n",
      "Vertical or common-size analysis reduces all items on a statement to a \"common size\" as a percentage of some base value which assists in comparability with other companies of different sizes. [ 3 ] As a result, all Income Statement items are divided by Sales, and all Balance Sheet items are divided by Total Assets. [ 4 ]\n",
      "Another method is comparative analysis. This provides a better way to determine trends. Comparative analysis presents the same information for two or more time periods and is presented side-by-side to allow for easy analysis. [ 5 ]\n",
      "Theoretical challenges [ edit ]\n",
      "Financial ratios face several theoretical challenges:\n",
      "They say little about the firm's prospects in an absolute sense. Their insights about relative performance require a reference point from other time periods or similar firms.\n",
      "One ratio holds little meaning. As indicators, ratios can be logically interpreted in at least two ways. [ why? ] One can partially overcome this problem by combining several related ratios to paint a more comprehensive picture of the firm's performance.\n",
      "Seasonal factors may prevent year-end values from being representative. A ratio's values may be distorted as account balances change from the beginning to the end of an accounting period. Use average values for such accounts whenever possible.\n",
      "Financial ratios are no more objective than the accounting methods employed. Changes in accounting policies or choices can yield drastically different ratio values. [ 6 ]\n",
