      "Since our last forecast was published in early December, a new administration has taken office in Washington, D.C., and there has been a deluge of economically impactful policies and announcements. The new president outlined many policy proposals during the campaign, and since his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, we have started to get a sense of how his administration plans to implement these proposals.\n",
      "From a macroeconomic perspective, the most significant actions taken by the new administration as of the time of writing (in late February) have been on tariffs and government operations. There have been numerous announcements of new tariffs‚Äîsome have gone into effect, some have been ‚Äúpaused,‚Äù and some are yet to come into force. On government operations, the administration is seeking to downsize and reshape the federal government through technology modernization, enhanced government efficiency, head count reductions, acquisition reform, and reducing spending. Trump has proposed reducing the size of some agencies and/or transferring governmental functions from one agency to another and is looking for potential fraud and errant payments in government programs.¬†\n",
      "Although it is still early days, and we still have many outstanding questions about policy specifics, the new administration appears to be driving a substantial reordering of the economic landscape. Sea changes like these make economic forecasting difficult, particularly in the face of uncertainty. We have produced three scenarios, detailed in the next section below, which capture a range of possible futures.1\n",
      "Scenarios\n",
      "Baseline (50%)2: Our baseline scenario aims to represent a ‚Äúmiddle of the road‚Äù outcome. It is our assessment of the likely trajectory of the economy in the absence of major upside or downside risks. On the positive side, it includes an expansion of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a modest boost from deregulation. However, we also assume a relatively modest increase in tariff rates, modest federal spending cuts, and a more stringent immigration policy that largely balance out the aforementioned expansionary policies.\n",
      "We expect the TCJA will be extended, avoiding a sudden increase in income taxes, and we expect that the corporate tax rate will be lowered for American producers in line with campaign promises.3 Deregulation will continue throughout the next few years. The productivity boost from this is expected to remain relatively modest in the near term as policy uncertainty delays and limits the benefits of cutting red tape.\n",
      "While it is not yet clear which tariffs will be introduced or which will ‚Äústick,‚Äù we do expect that there will be some level of new and lasting tariffs. We model this by adding five percentage points to the average tariff rate on all imported goods, which stood at 3.3% in 2024. We also expect that some spending cuts will prove lasting. Over the course of a few years, total net savings of US$200 billion are found in federal outlays compared with a scenario where there were no cuts (the actual dollar reduction in federal spending is much less than this number, because we bake in underlying spending growth due to population growth and inflation). Finally, we expect that deportations of undocumented immigrants will be lower than they were in 2024.\n",
      "However, we expect the number of deportations to be about 15% higher than the average seen over the last five years.\n",
      "In this scenario, individuals and businesses front-load some trade activity early in 2025 to avoid tariffs; as tariffs take effect, trade slows later this year and into next. We forecast real exports will grow by 0.7% in 2025 and 1% in 2026, while real imports will grow by 1.8% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026. The inflationary effects of tariffs mean the Federal Reserve can only manage 75 basis points of cuts over the next 24 months. Real consumer spending grows by 2.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. Government spending cuts and layoffs continue over the next few years, which subtract value from overall growth. Overall, our modeling shows real GDP growth of 2.6% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. GDP growth then averages 1.9% per year over the remaining three years of the forecast.4\n",
      "Trade deals and deregulation (25%): Our upside scenario explores the possibility that the economy could unlock a new level of growth thanks to productivity-enhancing technology, tax cuts, and deregulation. In this scenario, we examine what might happen if these hopes come true. As in the baseline, the TCJA tax cuts are extended, and the corporate tax rate is lowered to 15% for domestic producers. That, as well as breakthroughs in novel technologies like artificial intelligence, prompts a boost in investment, which results in a productivity boom.\n",
      "We maintain tariffs at 2024 levels in this scenario, working on the theory that the new administration is primarily interested in using tariffs as a negotiating tactic to extract concessions from trading partners. Likewise, deportations under the current administration continue at a similar pace as the previous administration.\n",
      "In this scenario, real GDP will rise by 2.9% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026. Growth averages 2.9% over the remaining three years of the forecast‚Äîone percentage point above the average in the baseline scenario. With fewer tariffs in place, this scenario also predicts lower inflation compared to the baseline, stronger consumer spending starting in 2026, and a lower merchandise trade deficit. The booming economy results in a lower unemployment rate than in the baseline scenario.\n",
      "Trade wars and persistent inflation (25%): While our baseline does incorporate some significant policy changes from the new administration, it does not reflect the full scope of potential changes to trade and immigration policy. We therefore modeled an alternate scenario where more impactful versions of these policies are implemented.\n",
      "In this scenario, we raised the average tariff rate on goods imports by 10 percentage points. As a point of comparison, this magnitude of tariffs is approximately equivalent to a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian imports; the average import duty has not been this high since World War II. The tariffs raise the price of final goods for American consumers and raise the cost of intermediate imports for American producers. Exporters are also affected by the appreciation in the US dollar caused by the tariffs, making American products less affordable for foreign buyers.\n",
      "As a result, exports are flat in 2025. While we do not model retaliation by trading partners in our scenarios, it is reasonable to assume that they would levy reciprocal tariffs or boycott American goods. The extent to which these dynamics further reduce American exports depend as much on psychology as on economics. While the tariffs could result in the reshoring of manufacturing to America, the macroeconomic benefits of this will take time to materialize.\n",
      "We include larger government spending cuts in this scenario, with spending eventually falling US$1 trillion below its status quo trend. While a small portion of these cuts come from reductions in headcount and the consolidation of departments and agencies, other spending cuts will necessarily need to be enacted through the Congressional budget process. As in the baseline scenario, the TCJA tax cuts are extended, and the corporate tax rate is cut to 15% for American producers.\n",
      "While the vice president has floated the possibility that 1 million undocumented immigrants could be deported each year under the new administration,5 we think it would be very difficult to deport such a large number of people. In this scenario, we allow deportations to rise by 250,000 per year, roughly doubling the rate of the previous administration. This reduces population growth and would have an impact on some industries, like agriculture and hospitality, where undocumented immigrants make up a significant share of the total workforce.\n",
      "Overall, economic growth slows considerably to 2.2% in 2025 and 1.3% in 2026. The fight against inflation is slower than expected, and the Fed holds off on rate cuts in 2025 before beginning to cut again in 2026.\n",

      "Consumer spending\n",
      "Real consumer spending continues to fare well. For the fourth quarter of 2024, overall real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 4.2% (at annual rates), even stronger than the 3.7% growth recorded in the third quarter. Spending on durable goods in particular remains elevated, growing by 12.1% in the fourth quarter after rising more than 7% in the third quarter.\n",
      "Despite this strong base, uncertainty is affecting consumer confidence as of this writing. A fear of price increases from tariffs caused the University of Michigan consumer sentiment, a monthly survey of consumer confidence levels in the United States, to fall 9.8% in February to 64.7, with all ages, income brackets, and wealth levels, and all five index components posting a decline.6 Leading the decrease was the 19% decrease in buying conditions for durables as year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 3.3% in January to 4.3% in February, the highest level recorded since November 2023. In addition, the Conference Board‚Äôs consumer confidence index declined seven points in February to 98.3, the largest monthly decline since August 2021.7\n",
      "Short-term gains in consumer spending are expected to be driven by growing income and the ability of households to add new debt. Household debt continues to rise, increasing by US$93 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.8 We expect the Fed will cut rates twice this year, enabling households to take on more debt, and therefore allow households to continue spending in the short term, even if significant tariffs were imposed. We also expect consumers will be doing some front-loading in early 2025 to try to get ahead of tariffs, which we see being slowly implemented over the course of the year.\n",
      "Overall, we forecast real consumer spending will rise 2.9% this year before growing at a slower 1.4% pace in 2026. Lower interest rates should help boost demand for durable goods, boosting spending on that category by 3.3% in 2025 before tariffs bring growth to just 0.8% in 2026. Spending on nondurables is expected to rise by 2.6% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. Finally, spending on services is expected to increase by 2.8% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 as services will be less impacted by tariffs. Uncertain consumers have brought our consumption forecast down from our previous forecast.\n",

      "Housing\n",
      "While interest rates have started to decline, mortgage rates remain elevated at the time of writing, causing housing starts to fall 9.8% in January to 1.366 million after strong increases in December.9 Although building permits remained relatively flat, elevated borrowing costs continue to weigh on affordability for buyers. During the 2010s, housing starts did not return to their peak levels from before the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009. The long-term failure to build enough homes has contributed to the housing crisis we see today in some parts of the country, and we may have to wait for rates to drop to see a significant uptick in housing construction. One opportunity for the new administration could be to pursue initiatives to promote the building of housing.\n",
      "After rising at the end of the last year, we expect housing starts to continue falling throughout the first half of 2025, before rising again in the latter half of 2025. Overall, in 2025, we expect housing starts to rise to almost 1.3 million and to almost 1.4 million in 2026. We anticipate housing starts to continue rising for the remainder of the forecast period once the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowers rates once again. For the entirety of the forecast period, we expect the housing stock to rise more rapidly than total population, helped in part by the slower population growth.\n",
      "Despite strong projected construction levels in the medium to long term, real affordability requires more ‚Äústarter homes‚Äù to be built in parts of the country experiencing the largest increases in population. We expect the benchmark home price index will rise by 3.7% in 2025, with a further 3.3% growth in 2026. In the outer year of the forecast, the house price index is expected to rise more rapidly once again.\n",

      "Business investment\n",
      "Investment is spending that helps grow the long-term productive capacity of the economy, and as such, is one of the most important indicators of an economy‚Äôs future potential. Investment often follows a cyclical pattern, driven by commodity price booms and economic cycles. It can also be incentivized by policies like lower taxes or subsidies for investments.\n",
      "Business confidence is a crucial determinant of the level of investment growth, as businesses need to feel positive about their future potential to justify spending money to grow their operations. Unfortunately, business confidence is weakening in the face of uncertainty. The National Federation of Independent Business‚Äô small business optimism index dropped in January and February.10 In addition, several regional Federal Reserve Bank surveys reported a sharp drop in the outlook for business conditions.11\n",
      "Interest rates also influence investment. The average corporate borrowing rate increased to nearly 7% by the end of 2023 and remained above 6% throughout 2024, presenting a barrier to firms who need to borrow to invest. However, many firms still have more cash on hand than they did before the pandemic,12 and they can consequently avoid borrowing at these rates.\n",
      "After posting a 1.1% decline in the last quarter of 2024, we predict investment in structures to fall another 1.4% in the first quarter of 2025 before slowly rising once again. Overall, we predict investment in structures to fall 0.1% in 2025 but rise 4.2% in 2026, which is significantly below the 10.8% gains recorded in 2023.\n",
      "Besides structures construction, other types of business investment include spending on machinery and equipment (M&E), such as on computers or industrial equipment, and on intellectual property, such as software or AI. Both types of spending have seen a strong upward trend over time, although M&E spending fell by 7.8% in the final quarter of 2024. We expect the strong growth trend to return for the rest of the forecast period. The resumption of bonus depreciation that has been gradually phased out under the TCJA is expected to support such spending. Our forecast shows M&E investments rising 2.3 % in 2025, with growth picking up to 6.3% in 2026. We see intellectual property spending rising 4.3% in 2025 and 4.9% in 2026.\n",
      "Overall, in 2025, we predict business investment to rise 3.4%, slowing slightly from the 3.7% recorded in 2024. However, once uncertainty starts to ease, we expect growth in business investment to pick up, rising 6.3% in 2026.\n",

      "Foreign trade\n",
      "Foreign trade remains the sector with the biggest question marks surrounding it. Tariff details are being changed on a near-daily basis. At the time of writing, some of the measures that have been announced (but have not necessarily taken effect) include a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada and Mexico; 20% additional tariffs on Chinese imports; 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors; and expected reciprocal tariffs against all countries‚Äô tariff and nontariff barriers to trade.13 Given the difficulty of predicting the specific package of tariffs that will be introduced, or the possible length of time they will remain in force, we have chosen to build our forecast around the potential increase in the average tariff rate, rather than on a specific selection of imports.\n",
      "In our baseline scenario, we raise the average tariff rate on goods imports by five percentage points, from approximately 3.3% to 8.3%. This level implies that many of the proposed tariffs will not end up being implemented, or will not be left in place for long. Readers can also refer to our downside scenario, which contains a 10-percentage-point increase in the average tariff rate, for an indication of what might happen if a larger range of tariffs do take effect, or take effect for longer. That downside scenario would be roughly equivalent to a permanent 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada.14\n",
      "Although the tariffs in our baseline scenario are less ambitious than some of the numbers recently floated, their impact are expected to be significant, and much greater than what we saw during the president‚Äôs first term. The imposition of these tariffs is likely to turn into a complicated process involving individuals and businesses trying to make substitution and supply chain decisions based on new relative prices. As tariffs take effect at some point this year, we expect growth in exports and imports to rise by only 0.7% and 1.8% in 2025, respectively. Growth will remain limited in 2026, with exports rising only 1% and import growth slowing to 0.9%.\n",
      "It may be surprising to see that exports may suffer as much as imports by the imposition of tariffs. There are a few reasons why this is the case in the short term, and why these tariffs may not have their desired impact in the long run. First, about half of imports are currently used as intermediate inputs by US businesses. It is likely to take some time for US producers to find local alternatives to the goods they are currently importing, and in the meantime, their cost of doing business will rise. This dynamic could reduce the money available to firms to invest and may drive some US producers out of business if the costs are not passed on to consumers. It will also make their exports costlier and less competitive. Second, when the United States imposes tariffs on other countries‚Äô goods, it has the potential side effect of causing the US dollar to appreciate, leading exports from the United States to become relatively more expensive in other markets. Tariffs will shield US producers from the import competition required to make globally competitive products. So, while they may dominate the US economy, they are also likely to lose export sales, leading to limited net gain for American manufacturing.\n",
      "Many of the potential benefits of tariffs would take much longer than four years to be realized, and so do not occur within our forecast horizon. In most industries, there is not a large pool of American manufacturing production currently staffed up but sitting idle. Factories will need to be built and workers hired and trained, both of which will take time. During this transition period, when there are no US-alternative goods, the cost of tariffs is likely to be borne by American households and businesses. In many cases, the reason for offshoring has as much to do with the availability of certain skills as it does cost, and reshoring all this production will require major skills-training programs to ensure an adequate supply of workers.\n",

      "Government policy\n",
      "The new administration is seeking to cut government spending by establishing a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to coordinate this task. So far, more than 75,000 government employees‚Äîabout 3% of the total federal workforce‚Äîhave reportedly accepted buyout offers.15 The administration has also said it will lay off all federal employees still on probation, a group that numbers 220,000,16 though the courts have since delayed these efforts. The federal government spends about US$270 billion on salaries for workers; assuming these layoffs all occur, and are not offset by new hiring for the administration‚Äôs priorities, they would save around US$30 billion per year‚Äîor 0.5% of total federal spending.\n",
      "Several agencies, such as the United States Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have been severely downsized. As of this writing, the president is expected to issue an executive order that eliminates all functions that are not statutorily mandated by Congress. The extent to which these actions have a material impact on spending remains to be seen. Some of the cuts have been put on hold by the courts, as some of the spending represents Congressionally mandated spending.17 According to the latest projections from the Congressional Budget Office, the federal government is on track to spend US$39.5 billion on international development and US$144.5 billion on education and training in 2025.18 Eliminating this spending would require bipartisan support in the Senate.\n",
      "In addition to the potential savings mentioned above, it is quite likely that the new administration and Congressional Republicans will have their own priority areas that will attract new spending, so the net savings will likely be somewhat less. We therefore assume a total of US$200 billion per year in net spending reductions. Of course, government spending is always naturally increasing with time due to population growth and inflation, so this figure represents savings versus a counterfactual where the cuts did not occur, not dollar reductions in overall federal spending.\n",
      "On the revenue side, we assume that the TCJA tax cuts are extended at a cost of approximately US$4.5 trillion over 10 years.19 We think the tariffs modeled in this scenario could bring in approximately US$100 billion per year in new revenue, but retaliatory action by trading partners could require additional spending by the federal government‚Äîa dynamic observed in the president‚Äôs first term.20 Tariffs therefore have no net impact on revenues in the baseline scenario. In addition, Congressional Republicans are discussing whether to offset some of the cost through other budgetary savings such as spending cuts or revenue raisers.\n",
      "Overall, we forecast the federal budget deficit as a share of GDP to rise slightly from 6.2% in 2024 to 6.8% in 2025 before falling in the remaining years of the forecast as economic growth outpaces spending growth. With the deficit as a share of GDP falling in the longer term, we predict the 10-year federal bond rate will fall from 4.44% in 2025 to 3.95% by 2029.\n",

The unemployment rate came down to 4% in January 2025, while nonfarm payroll increased by 143,000, only slightly below the 12-month average monthly gains of 166,000 observed in 2024.\n",
      "In the long term, demographics are the most important determinant for labor markets. On that front, perhaps the biggest question mark remains the new administration‚Äôs immigration policy. According to recent estimates from the Migration Policy Institute, there were approximately 13.7 million undocumented immigrants in the United States as of mid-2023.21 Around three-quarters of them are a part of the labor force,22 though they are not evenly distributed across industries. Some industries rely much more on undocumented workers: According to the Department of Agriculture, 42% of agricultural workers are undocumented.23 Thus, the impact of deportations on labor supply (and therefore on wages and prices) will differ significantly across sectors of the economy. Overall, fewer people in the labor force would translate in a slower pace of job growth, as employers struggle to fill some positions.\n",
      "During the election campaign, Vice President Vance indicated that deportations could reach 1 million people per year under the new administration.24 This would represent a quadrupling compared with the figure from the previous administration, and this level of deportation would result in very weak (or even negative) population growth over the forecast, with knock-on effects for labor markets.\n",
      "However, to date, we have not seen evidence of that magnitude of enforcement action. Since Jan. 20, 2025, 37,000 people have been removed from the United States, below the 2024 pace of deportations.25 Ongoing appointments and staffing changes at Immigration and Customs Enforcement could potentially lead to further deportations over the rest of the year.26 For now, though, our baseline scenario expects an additional 100,000 annual deportations compared with the previous administration. The current administration has acknowledged that lack of budgetary resources impacts its ability to deport undocumented migrants. They have asked Congress for US$175 billion to help facilitate the immigration enforcement and border security efforts.\n",
      "For readers interested in the implications of this immigration policy approach, our downside scenario (see beginning of the article) assumes deportations reach an additional 250,000 per year, which is below the one million used in our downside scenario in our previous forecast.\n",
      "During the president‚Äôs first term, there was no major change in legal immigration levels.27¬†We therefore do not have any changes to legal immigration levels in any of our scenarios.\n",
      "Another factor that will affect employment levels this year are the ongoing layoffs in the federal government. So far, more than 75,000 government employees have accepted buyouts,28¬†and the administration has said it will lay off the 220,000 federal employees still on probation.29¬†However, the removal of probationary employees has been challenged in the courts.30\n",
      "We expect strong jobs growth to continue in the first quarter of 2025, but a slower pace for the remainder of this year and next. Although the unemployment rate fell in January, we expected it to rise again throughout 2025 and the first half of 2026 as the private sector struggles to incorporate the potential wave of newly unemployed government workers. That would cause the unemployment rate to rise above 4.5% by the third quarter of 2025 and remain elevated for the remainder of the forecast period.\n",

      "Stock markets have shown volatility since inauguration, with the S&P 500 down slightly from its level on Jan. 20, 2025 at the time of writing in late February.31 Heightened uncertainty has also caused the US dollar to weaken after posting strong post-election gains.\n",
      "Since the FOMC began its rate-cutting cycle, it cut rates worth 100 basis points, bringing the Fed‚Äôs target range to between 4.25% and 4.5%. However, policymakers are now entering a period of harder choices on interest rates.\n",
      "In our baseline scenario, we think the Fed will only manage to cut rates twice this year. Stubborn inflation will slow the speed at which interest rates can be brought back to neutral, with rates finally settling at 2.875% in December 2027. In all scenarios, we expect that FOMC will maintain its independence and with its mandate remaining unchanged.\n",

      "Prices\n",
      "After falling through the summer and into the early fall of 2024, year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation for all items has started to rise again, returning to 3% in January. While prices increased for a wide range of products and services, what caught people‚Äôs attention was the 15% increase in the price of eggs, the largest rise recorded in almost 10 years. In addition, the Fed‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation‚Äîthe personal consumption expenditures deflator‚Äîcame in at 2.6% year over year in December, moving further away from the Fed‚Äôs target.\n",
      "Perhaps even more worryingly from the Fed‚Äôs perspective, consumers‚Äô expectations of future inflation are starting to rise as well. In the Conference Board‚Äôs February survey of consumer confidence, forward inflation expectations shot up from 5.2% to 6%;32 in the University of Michigan‚Äôs February survey, forward inflation expectations rose from 3.3% to 4.3%.33 Because inflation expectations tend to feed through into actual inflation, the Fed‚Äôs role involves controlling not only real prices but also expectations of inflation. These data points, as well as the potential inflationary effects of tariffs, will give the FOMC a pause when considering if further interest rate cuts are appropriate.\n",
      "Overall, we expect CPI inflation to remain stubbornly high in 2025 at 2.8%. Over the forecast period, we expect CPI inflation to remain above 2%, limiting the speed at which rates can be brought back down to neutral.\n",

That was the lowest rate for core inflation since March 2021.watch nowVIDEO3:5903:59Inflation rate falls to 2.4% in March, lower than expectedSquawk BoxConsumer price inflation eased more than expected in March as President Donald Trump prepared to launch tariffs against U.S. trading partners, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.The consumer price index, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in March, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.4%, down from 2.8% in February.Excluding food and energy, so-called core inflation ran at a 2.8% annual rate, having increased 0.1% for the month. That was the lowest rate for core inflation since March 2021.Wall Street had been looking for headline inflation of 2.6% and core at 3%, according to the Dow Jones consensus.Slumping energy prices helped keep inflation tame, as a 6.3% drop in gasoline prices helped drive a 2.4% broader decline in the energy index. Food prices climbed 0.4% on the month. Egg prices rose another 5.9% and were up 60.4% from a year ago.Moreover, shelter prices, among the most stubborn components of inflation, increased just 0.2% in March and were up 4% on a 12-month basis, the smallest gain since November 2021. Used vehicle prices were off 0.7% while new vehicle costs increased just 0.1%, ahead of tariffs that are expected to hit the auto industry hard.Airline fares declined 5.3% in March and motor vehicle insurance dropped 0.8% and prescription drugs fell 2%.Stock market futures indicated a sharply lower open on Wall Street following the release, while Treasury yields also were negative.The report comes a day after Trump's stunning reversal of parts of his tariff plans as he announced a delay in some of the most aggressive of the duties put in place against dozens of nations. Instead, Trump let stand a 10% blanket levy on all imports announced last week and set a 90-day window during which the White House will negotiate the higher tariffs.While Trump campaigned on bringing down inflation, progress had been slow to start 2025.The president nevertheless has called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Central bank officials have expressed a reluctance to move with so much policy uncertainty in the air, and market pricing indicates the Fed will wait until June before lowering rates again.The nature of the tariffs has led most economists to expect a significant bump in inflation, though that's less clear now that Trump has opened the negotiation window.\"Today's softer than expected CPI release feels backward looking given the large changes to trade policy seen in recent days,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Going forward the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft.\"Futures market pricing after the CPI report indicated little change in market expectations for interest rates, with traders pricing in three or four cuts by the end of the year.Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVEJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?

High inflation can have negative effects on the stock market. When inflation rises, interest rates may also increase to combat it. Stocks have historically outperformed other asset classes over time, but the best approach can vary depending on the inflation environment. Moderate inflation can lead to higher growth and increased stock prices, while high inflation can lead to higher interest rates and lower stock prices. It is essential to adjust investment strategies to keep pace with rising prices during inflation. The impact of inflation on the stock market can be both positive and negative, depending on several factors, including the level of inflation, interest rates, and the overall state of the economy.\u001b[00m\n",

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast‚Äôs expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property‚Äîsuch as the use of AI and other novel technologies‚Äîwill continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "real GDP forecasted to range between 1.6% and 1.9% per year. Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around three interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts, 2) persistent inflation, and 3) financial system stress. Major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have been simmering for some time; either or both could flare up to a higher level. We see the most likely impact of such escalation coming in the form of higher prices of imported goods and oil. In this scenario, the price of oil spikes to around US$100 for three quarters before gradually declining. Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with guns. The past two American administrations have used tariffs and sanctions to varying degrees as tools to influence adversaries. The use of these tools can have an impact on the prices faced by American firms and consumers. In this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and imported final goods by a further 1%. As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this action, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the second quarter of 2025. The latest Federal Reserve Financial Stability Report4 highlights three near-term risks to the stability of the financial system: higher-for-longer interest rates; worsening geopolitical conflict and spillovers; and strains on real-estate markets, particularly for office real estate. In line with the other assumptions outlined above, we therefore model an increase in stress in the financial system. In this scenario, GDP growth is lower than in the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.2%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented, and growth in 2025 is just 0.6%. Growth averages 1.7% per year from 2026 to 2028. A golden era\n",

One of the challenges of higher interest rates is that while high rates help rein in inflation in the short term by bringing down demand, they can paradoxically cause inflationary pressures to persist for longer by making it more expensive for firms to invest in the capacity to produce more and relieve supply pressures. The average corporate borrowing rate shot up to nearly 7% by the end of 2023, up from a low of 2.3% in 2020. On the bright side, in the first quarter of 2024, the cost of borrowing fell to an average of 6.6% and is predicted to continue declining throughout most of 2024. As a result, although we predict growth in business investment to slow overall in 2024 compared to 2023, average growth for this year is expected to come in at 3% and is predicted to rise further in the medium term. Like all countries, the United States will have to face the challenges caused by rapidly changing climate conditions. Some of these challenges are from a higher prevalence of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and drought, which lead to loss of life and property from flooding, wildfires, and damage to farmland. Other challenges are related to the need for increased economic investment to prevent even worse effects of warming going forward. After falling almost 0.3% in 2023, the forecast shows spending on machinery and equipment rising 1.3% this year and 2.7% in 2025.

      "### Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation is a pressing concern for investors and policymakers alike. The US inflation rate has decreased to 2.4% in March 2025, down from 2.8% in February. This report provides an analysis of the impact of inflation on the stock market in 2024, including data visualizations and clear recommendations for content creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Inflation and Stock Market Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between inflation and the stock market is complex. Moderate inflation can lead to higher growth and increased stock prices, while high inflation can lead to higher interest rates and lower stock prices. According to a report by Hartford Funds, equities have outperformed inflation 90% of the time when inflation was low (below 3% on average) and rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Current Market Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "The current market trends indicate that the US economy is expected to post real GDP growth of 2.4% in 2024, with growth slowing to 1.1% in 2025. The unemployment rate is expected to fall in the short term, but rise to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, with growth in intellectual property products such as R&D and digital content showing stronger resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact of Inflation on Investor Sentiment\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation can have a significant impact on investor sentiment. High inflation can lead to higher interest rates, which can decrease demand for stocks and increase volatility in the market. According to a report by Bankrate, higher inflation rates, typically above 3%, could increase volatility across the economy and stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Content Creation\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made for content creation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Focus on moderate inflation**: Moderate inflation can lead to higher growth and increased stock prices. Content creators should focus on the benefits of moderate inflation and how it can impact the stock market.\n",
      "2. **Highlight the importance of business investment**: Business investment is critical for economic growth, and content creators should highlight the importance of investment in intellectual property products such as R&D and digital content.\n",
      "3. **Emphasize the need for a diversified portfolio**: Inflation can lead to higher interest rates and volatility in the market. Content creators should emphasize the need for a diversified portfolio to mitigate these risks.\n",
      "4. **Provide updates on current market trends**: Content creators should provide regular updates on current market trends, including GDP growth, unemployment rates, and business investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data Visualizations\n",
      "\n",
      "The following data visualizations are provided to illustrate the impact of inflation on the stock market:\n",

      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, inflation is a critical factor that can impact the stock market. Moderate inflation can lead to higher growth and increased stock prices, while high inflation can lead to higher interest rates and lower stock prices. Content creators should focus on the benefits of moderate inflation, highlight the importance of business investment, emphasize the need for a diversified portfolio, and provide regular updates on current market trends. By following these recommendations, content creators can provide valuable insights and analysis to investors and help them make informed decisions.\n",

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast‚Äôs expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property‚Äîsuch as the use of AI and other novel technologies‚Äîwill continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025.

      "As we move further into 2024, the lingering effects of inflation on the US economy are ever more salient. After a decrease to **2.4%** in **March** from **2.8%** in **February**, understanding the nuances of inflation and its impact on the stock market becomes crucial for investors. \n",

      "Inflation can fundamentally alter the landscape for equities. Historical data shows that stocks can outperform inflation **90%** of the time when inflation levels are low (below **3%**). However, in a high-inflation environment, this dynamic shifts significantly. As inflation rises, interest rates also increase, which leads to elevated borrowing costs and often results in decreased stock valuations. \n",
